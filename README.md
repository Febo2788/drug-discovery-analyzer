## üöÄ Project Description

This interactive web application is a powerful tool for **early-stage drug discovery**, designed to bridge the gap between raw chemical data and actionable insights. In the fast-paced biotech industry, the ability to rapidly analyze, visualize, and filter large compound libraries is critical. This dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to perform key chemoinformatic analyses, accelerating the identification of promising drug candidates.

### Biotech Applications

-   **Hit Identification:** Quickly sift through thousands of compounds from high-throughput screens to identify potential 'hits' that meet specific physicochemical and activity criteria.
-   **Lead Optimization:** Interactively explore structure-activity relationships (SAR) by filtering on properties like IC50, LogP, and molecular weight to guide the chemical optimization of lead compounds.
-   **Candidate De-risking:** Proactively flag and filter out compounds with properties associated with poor pharmacokinetics or toxicity (e.g., violations of Lipinski's Rule of Five), saving valuable time and resources.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Deep Dive

The dashboard integrates several key chemoinformatic analyses:

-   **Lipinski's Rule of Five:** A rule of thumb to evaluate the 'drug-likeness' of a chemical compound. It predicts that a compound is more likely to have good oral bioavailability if it satisfies the following criteria:
    -   Molecular Weight (MW) ‚â§ 500 Daltons
    -   LogP (a measure of lipophilicity) ‚â§ 5
    -   Hydrogen Bond Donors (HBD) ‚â§ 5
    -   Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (HBA) ‚â§ 10
-   **IC50:** The half maximal inhibitory concentration, which represents the concentration of a drug that is required for 50% inhibition in vitro. It is a standard measure of a compound's potency.
-   **Molecular Properties (MW, LogP, HBD, HBA, PSA):** These physicochemical properties are critical determinants of a drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) profile.
